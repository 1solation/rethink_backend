# Crowdsource Voting App - Backend
This repository contains the website and functions used to interface with the firebase firestore server. The website served as a backend tool supporting the development and running of the primary Crowdsource Voting App. The website functioned as an admin portal where User data and Poll data could be adjusted or deleted by an administrator with the goal of moderating the mobile application. 

The website's functionality was also extended to work as a web based alternative to the app allowing for users participate in voting and poll creation without having to use the mobile version.   

The website was code using HTML and javascript with bootstrap being used for the layout, the site itself was hosted by Firebase using Cloud Firestore as the NOSQL database. The site's development was kept simple as it wasnt the primary goal of the course work, instead it became the tool used to better understand how Cloud Forestore worked until it eventually was improved upon, becoming a functional backend site.
